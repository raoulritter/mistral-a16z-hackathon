# Le Kellen 👨‍🦯 👩‍🦯 - Part of HackUK - A16Z / Mistral AI hackathon

This project is a Vision-Impaired Assistance Application that uses advanced AI models to help visually impaired individuals navigate their environment and perform tasks. The application processes audio input, live images, and floor plans to provide detailed navigation instructions and task assistance.

## Features👨‍🦯

- Audio transcription using the whipser-v3-turbo model

- Image processing and analysis

- Natural language understanding and task processing using Mistral AI

- Real-time navigation assistance

- Integration with floor plans for improved spatial awareness

## Tech Stack

- Backend: FastAPI

- AI Models: 

  - OpenAI Whisper (for speech recognition)

  - Pixtral by Mistral AI (for natural language processing and task understanding)

- Image Processing: OpenCV

- Frontend and input loading
    React and NextJs.
